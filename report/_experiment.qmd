In this chapter we go over the methodology details of our experiment. The conducted experiment had the goal to (TODO)....
This was done by collecting gaze data and analyzing the gaze behavior of the participants (referenz n√§chstes Kapitel). We are interested in comparing the gaze behavior of the participants when they are presented with static images or moving images accompanied by a related audible sentence.

## Participants

We had 10 people participating in our experiment between the ages 18 and 34 where nine people identified as male and one as female.Regarding the English level, most (6) people specified that they have reached at least a C1 level and the remaining (4) people were at a B2 level. Additionally, we asked the participants about their previous experience with eye tracking. For the majority (7) it was the first time using eye trackers, the other three stated that they have used eye trackers before.

Overall, all the participants were able to complete the experiment successfully within 10 to 15 minutes after the calibration.

## Study Procedure and Apparatus
To test our hypothesis, we needed to invite participants to partake in our experiment.
We recruited participants by asking for volunteers in our circle of acquaintances and we invited the interested people between mid-july and august. Our target sample size was at least ten participants to end up with at least five people per condition group.
Once a participant arrived, they were given an information sheet with a brief description of the experiment and what kind of devices are going to get used and their corresponding safety risks. Additonally, they were asked to sign a standard consent form for studies with humans that are conducted at the university. 
To execute the experiment, we used a standard desktop PC with two displays standing back to back in duplicate view, where one was directed to the participant and the other was used by the conductor to start the experiment.
