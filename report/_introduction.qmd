## Background
The role of language and visual processing has been studied by many researchers using eye tracking in the visual world paradigm (VWP). VWP is a useful eye-tracking technique which consists of visual scenes that a participant views while listening to some spoken utterances. Participants look at the visual display which contains pictures of objects, meanwhile, the eye tracker monitors the eye movements as the heard language unfolds over time. The spoken utterance can extend from a single word to short narrative or even a story, and the utterance can be related to more than one object. When the eye movement of a saccade (a quick change of gaze moves from one point of fixation to another) happens, the eye tracker yields a time estimation at which word and corresponding picture has been identified on the visual scene while listening to the utterance. In this respect, VWP examines the relationship between the visual stimuli and language input, which also offers a different insight of exploring the integration of visual and language processing happening in the brain (Huettig at al, 2011 & Berends et al, 2016).

How people interpret and process spoken language in the context of their contemporary visual field and how eye movements are involved as the language is being processed were first demonstrated experimentally by Cooper (1974). However, the vast majority of researchers have not considered the effects of Cooperâ€™s study, and there is a relatively small body of literature that is concerned with the language processing and eye movements. 

After a few decades, since Tanenhaus et al. (1995) introduced the influential study of VWP in real-time spoken language comprehension, the rapid development of VWP started to flourish in the field, additionally with the contemporary high quality eye-trackers, VWP also has a transformative influence in psycholinguistics (Clifton et al, 2007).
